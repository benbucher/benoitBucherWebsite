        "description": "My initial plans were to stay for five weeks in Peru and visit most of the touristic must see. However, Peruvian government took very strict measures on closing borders after only a dozen of cases of covid-19 in the country. Borders with Europe were closed within two days and I chose to go home before risking to get stuck in the country. As a result, I only had ten days in Peru to visit Lima and could not carry on with my trip to see the whole country. Lima is a huge capital; one could easily spend an hour to go from one district to another. Apart from the traffic and the heat, this huge city has delicious food to offer and many cultural highlights. I had a lot of fun taking minibuses for a few pesos to hang around from one ceviche bar to a museum.",
